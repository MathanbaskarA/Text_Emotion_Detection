# Text_Emotion_Detection
This project focuses on detecting human emotions from textual data using various Machine Learning algorithms. The model classifies emotions such as **joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt** based on text input.

## üß© Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special symbols using Regex and NLTK.
   - Tokenized and normalized text for efficient model training.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Used **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**
   - Implemented multiple algorithms:
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - Decision Tree Classifier

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Compared model performances using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **confusion matrix**.

5. **Results**
   - Achieved strong accuracy in predicting emotions, with SVM performing best among tested models.
