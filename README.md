# Text_Emotion_Detection
Developed a machine learning model to classify emotions such as joy, fear, anger, sadness, disgust, shame, and guilt from textual data. Performed text preprocessing with NLTK, applied TF-IDF vectorization, and evaluated SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models to achieve high accuracy in emotion prediction.
